# Automatizations
Here are some useful programas for my current job. Reminding that I've coded these programs to be accesible to laypeople use these programs.

## [SPED txt extractor](https://github.com/brunoserp/Automations/blob/main/SPED%20txt%20extractor.py) 
Extracts, from SPED txt file (a brazilian official tax file), a register level connected with its immediatly level up register. The final file is set as first level up register columns followed by its immediatly son register at right. Its required an Excel file with header info of each register.

## PDF merger.py:
## [PDF merger]([(https://github.com/brunoserp/Automations/blob/main/pdf%20merger.py)])
3 types of merge, which ones the user especifies answering the program questions:
- merge all PDFs from a folder
- merge only 1 page from all PDFs of a folder
- merge multiple pages from all PDFs of a folder

The final file is saved in the same folder of the PDFs.

## **Copy a list of files from a folder to another one.py**
## [Copy a list of files from a folder to another one]([(https://github.com/brunoserp/Automations/blob/main/copy%20a%20list%20of%20files%20from%20a%20folder%20to%20another%20one.py)])

The user interacts in the terminal to especify some features, as the folder where are the files and the folder to save the files.

## **Zip_xmls.py**
Zip 10.000 XML per time from a folder especified by the user on terminal.
If the number oe XML is not equal divisible by 10.000, the last ZIP saved will have the remaining ones.

## **Requested x sent invoices.py**
Some brazilian companies must deliver a file monthly called EFD ICMS, declaring all operations which ICMS incides over. EFD ICMS is divided by blocks, and there is one, C100, which has a field called invoice key, which is a 44 digit number composed of its operation features. Every invoice is supposed to have a XML, which one this program list as the requested invoices, and the compare it with XML sent.
It's possible to save a list of the requested XML, sent XML and invoice keys that weren't sent yet.

## **unzip all the files inside zip(s)**

## **list csv columns.py**
Listar o cabe√ßalho de um arquivo csv para facilitar o bulk insert no SQL.
